# GreatLakes-TempSensors

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Great Lakes Summer Fellows Program project focused on optimizing the placement of temperature sensors across the Great Lakes using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging the DeepSensor framework, we aim to improve the spatial network design for environmental monitoring, providing valuable insights into the Great Lakes' surface temperature variability. This project will serve as a proof-of-concept, allowing for expansion into other key variables, such as nutrients.

## Background
The Great Lakes are a critical natural resource, providing drinking water, transportation routes, recreational opportunities, and supporting a diverse ecosystem. However, monitoring such a vast area is challenging due to logistical constraints and resource limitations. This project seeks to utilize convolutional Gaussian neural processes, as formulated in the DeepSensor tool, to propose a strategic placement of temperature sensors, thereby optimizing the observation network.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and data analysis
