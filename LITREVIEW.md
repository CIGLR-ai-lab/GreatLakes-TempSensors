There has been an overall increase in average temperature, frost-free days, precipitation, and heavy precipitation events. Average ice cover continuous to have strong year-to-year variability and while there has been a trend of lower amounts in recent decades, high amounts are still possible.\

2. [Fine-scale spatial variation in ice cover and surface temperature trends across the surface of the Laurentian Great Lakes by Mason et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1721-2)\
Lake summer surface water temperatures(LSSWTs) have increased with decreased ice cover in past four decades, with water temperatures increasing faster than air temperatures. Ice duration shifted in Lakes Superior and Huron with El Nino(ENSO) winters of 1997-1998, while the other Great Lakes shifted in mid-80s. The Great Lakes have lost ~70% of their ice over since 1973. Highest rates of decline are found in eastern coastal areas, with highest decline in Lake Superior. There is large varibalility in LSSWT across the Great Lakes. LSSWT trends are as follows: Superior around coastline and eastern portion, Michigan north-central, and others in eastern regions. Depths greater than 100m have the fastest warming trends in all Great Lakes but Erie. Analysis performed spatial patterns concurrent with "bathymetry, predominant wind directionm and lake-wide circulation patterns".\


3. [A century of temperature variability in Lake Superior by Austin and Colman](https://doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.6.2724)\
All months show warming over the last century, with warming strongest in the summer(July-Sept) and weakest in the spring. During the summer the lakes become stratified, this stratified season in Lake Superior has increased in the past century. The rate of warming in the northern Great Lakes is significantly greater than the regional rate of atmospheric warming.\

4. [The pace of shifting seasons in lakes by Woolway](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37810-4s)\
Estimates suggest earlier spring, later autumnm and a lengthening summer season. "Since 1995, the period of summer temperatures has lengthened most dramatically in Lake Ontario". Maximum surface temperatures can occur late in the year due to the stratification and internia of the Great Lakes.\
